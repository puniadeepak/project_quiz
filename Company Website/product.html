                different forms of embroidery. Kutch is world renowned for its mirrored embroideries. 
                Most of these were traditionally stitched by village women, for themselves and their 
                families, to create festivity, honor deities, or generate wealth. Embroideries contributed 
                to the substantial economic exchange required for marriage and fulfilled other social 
                obligations which required gifts. Be it, thread work or leather every village has a 
                different and a unique style of making embroidery.

            <p><img src="images/woodcarving copy_0.jpg" alt="Image" style="float: left; width: 15%; height: 15%; margin-right: 1%;">
                Without modern Communications the sound of bells helped shepherds and cowherds communities to locate 
                their flocks from a distance. Waste iron sheets are bought from Bhuj market. Outlines are marked on 
                the sheets using master patterns (there are about 13 patterns ranging from 3" X 12/ 8". Following the 
                mark the sheet is cut. Then it is converted to the shape of bell with punching tools. Designs are worked 
                out before shaping it. The handle is fixed. Later copper (tamba) brass (pital) and tankankar in the form 
                of small bits and powder is sprinkeld on the bell immersed in mud water. Then clay is mixed with cotton which 
                serves as a mould. Then the mould is placed on a coal fire with the bell and the temperature is increased to 
                fuse the metal. Later near to its mouth the bell is beaten with hammer to obtain the desired sound. 
                Bells have an unusual resonant sound due to the individual tuning of each bell. Finally a tongue made of wood 
                is fixed from inside. Kutchi bells are moving very well in the foreign market as church bells.
